The purpose of Skeleton is to serve as an example of a basic Python package
including SetupTools capabilities, which will be migrated to Distribute in due 
course.

README      - This file, which should really be ReST
LICENSE     - The license under which this package is released. 
CHANGES     - An example change log document.
setup.py    - Template setup.py with lots of explanation. If you need a setup.py
              use this as a starting point.
setup.cfg   - Additional configuration for setup.py, includes the all import 
              'unittest' (used by Bitten) and 'nosetests' commands.
ez_setup.py - The setuptools bootstrap script, leave it alone!
              
Your packages should be organised like this.

Ignore the cruft

By the way, now’s a good time to create an 'ignore' file for your revision 
control system — you are using revision control, right? Since a bunch of this 
stuff gets generated, we don’t want to check it into revision control.

Here's what I recommend as a starting point.

 *.pyc
 *.pyo
 *.egg-info
 *~
 dist
 build
 .coverage
